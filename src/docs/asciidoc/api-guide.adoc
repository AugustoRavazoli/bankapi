=== Error Handling

==== Successful Requests

Successful requests return a response with HTTP status 200 (OK) or 201 (CREATED) or 204 (NO CONTENT) 
and contain a JSON structure in the response body (except for 204 status responses).

==== Validation Errors

POST and PUT requests against the Bank API expect a JSON structure in the request body,
GET, PUT and DELETE requests also expect to have a valid path variable.
If the JSON structure contains values that are invalid, 
the API returns a response with HTTP status 422 (UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY) that contains
an error JSON structure object that looks like this:

If some unexpected error occurs during the processing of a request, 
the Bank API returns a response with HTTP status 500 (internal server error).
